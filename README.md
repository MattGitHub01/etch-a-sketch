Etch-a-sketch project for The Odin Project.

This "Etch-A-Sketch" game is essentially a drawing pad with extra features! It allows the user to input a number which then makes a grid that is input x input in equally sized grid squares. The higher the number the more detailed the user's drawing capability is.
